+# nginx
+
+This repository represents the version of [nginx](https://nginx.com)
+that is used as part of the [Manta
+project](https://github.com/joyent/manta) in the
+[mako](https://github.com/joyent/manta-mako) project.
+
+We have changes to nginx currently covering the following broader
+features:
+
+* Returning calculated md5 checksums from streamed request bodies
+* Ensuring that the dav module properly renames are atomic (fsync)
+
+## Repository Management
+
+This repository is downstream of the [github nginx
+mirror](https://github.com/nginx/nginx).
+
+To better understand and maintain our differences from nginx, we try to
+manage branches and tags in a specific fashion. First and foremost, all
+branches and tags from the upstream nginx repository are mirrored here.
+
+Anything that is Joyent-specific begins with a `joyent/` prefix. The one
+exception to this is the old `mako` branch which represents the original
+changes we made against nginx back in 2012 and 2013.
+
+Branches with Joyent modifications are named `joyent/<version>`, such as
+`joyent/1.10.2`. This is a branch that starts from the nginx
+`release-1.10.2` tag. These branches will have all of our patches
+rebased on top of them. Currently, this repository is consumed by
+`mako`, which contains a git submodule for this repository. That
+submodule will point to a tag in this repository that uses the form
+`joyent/v<version>j<branch release num>`. The first release as described
+above would be: `joyent/v1.10.2j1`. If we need to cut another release
+from this branch, we would tag it `joyent/v1.10.2j2` and continue to
+increment the number after the `j`. Note we use the `j` instead of `r`
+which would more traditionally be used to indicate a revision.  We use
+`j` in case nginx for some reason wants to use it in its version strings
+for whatever reason.
+
+When it comes time to update to a newer version of nginx, we would take
+the following steps:
+
+* Ensure that we have pushed all changes from `nginx/nginx` and synced
+  all of our branches and tags.
+* Identify the release tag that corresponds to the point release. For
+  this example, we'll say that's `release-1.12.3`.
+* Create a new branch named `joyent/<version>` from the tag. In this
+  case we would name the branch `joyent/1.12.3`.
+* Rebase all of our patches on to that new branch, removing any patches
+  that are no longer necessary.
+* Test the new nginx binary.
+* Review and Commit all relevant changes.
+* Create a new tag `joyent/v1.12.3j1`.
+* Update the [manta-mako](https://github.com/joyent/manta-mako)
+  submodule to point to the new tag.
+
+## Licensing
+
+All of our changes to nginx are under the terms of nginx's 2-clause BSD
+license.
