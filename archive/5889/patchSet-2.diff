+# Binder Load Balancer (mname-balancer)
+
+This program is a simple DNS load balancer built to work with the Node-based
+[node-mname][mname] DNS server library, as used in the [Binder][binder] service
+discovery server.  A listen socket is established for both TCP and UDP on the
+nominated DNS server port to receive requests from remote peers.  A pool of
+connections to backend server processes is maintained via local sockets
+(`AF_UNIX`).
+
+```

+
+## Program Structure
+
+The program is broken up into different subsystems, each in a separate file.
+Each file has a comment which describes the particular subsystem in some
+detail.  Of particular note is the description of the protocol that forms an
+interface between this program and [node-mname][mname], which appears in
+`backends.c`.
+
+### Subsystems
+
+* `main.c`: program entry point, option parsing, initialisation, etc.
+
+* `backend.c`: enumeration of backend Binder processes, establishment
+  of a persistent connection with each backend, liveness checking,
+  detection of faults, etc.
+
+* `remotes.c`: maintaining the association between remote hosts and
+  their assigned backend.
+
+* `timeouts.c`: a lightweight, coarse-grained timeout mechanism used
+  by other subsystems to schedule future execution of maintenance
+  routines (e.g., socket data timeout); roughly analogous to
+  `setTimeout()` in JavaScript.
+
+* `udp_proxy.c`: establishes a UDP socket on the DNS port, and relays
+  DNS packets between remote hosts and backends via the persistent
+  connections maintained in `backend.c`.
+
+* `tcp_proxy.c`: establishes a TCP listen socket on the DNS port,
+  and proxies any incoming TCP connection to the appropriate
+  backend.
+
+### Dependencies
+
+The software depends on several other modules, included under the `deps/` tree.
+In some cases these dependencies are included as a submodule when an
+appropriate upstream git repository exists.  If modifications have been made,
+or if no such upstream yet exists, a copy has been made.  Current dependencies
+include:
+
+* `deps/illumos-bunyan` (copy): a private fork of the illumos [Bunyan][bunyan]
+  logging library, with some minor modifications
+
+* `deps/illumos-list` (submodule): illumos [list_create(9F)][list_create]
+  linked list routines
+
+* `deps/libcbuf` (submodule): buffer and buffer queue management routines
+
+* `deps/libcloop` (internal, no upstream yet): event ports-based event loop
+
+## Running
+
+The software has no persistent configuration file but does accept a number of
+command-line arguments.  It is expected that the correct set of arguments
+will be passed by the service supervisor; e.g., the [binder-balancer][smf]
+service shipped with Binder.  Supported options include:
+
+* `-b IP_ADDRESS`: the IP interface address on which to listen for DNS packets
+  (default `0.0.0.0`, or all interfaces)
+
+* `-p PORT`: the port number to use when listening for both TCP and UDP DNS
+  packets (default `53`)
+
+* `-l LOG_LEVEL`: the [Bunyan][bunyan] log level (default `info`; valid
+  levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`)
+
+* `-s BACKEND_PATH`: the directory where `AF_UNIX` sockets for Binder
+  backends will be created (required; no default)
+
+A log level string may also be passed in the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
+If that variable is set, it will override a `-l` value passed on the command
+line.
+
+## Building
+
+This software is written for illumos systems; in particular, SmartOS.
+
+### Development
+
+For development purposes it is possible to build this repository directly.
+In a SmartOS zone, install appropriate build tools:
+
+* C compiler and GNU make; e.g., `pkgin install build-essential`
+* CTF tools in `/opt/ctf`; [see ctftools README][ctftools]
+
+With those tools installed, you should be able to build the balancer program
+with `gmake`.  The resultant binary will be called `bbal`.
+
+### Release
+
+Release builds of the software are driven through the `Makefile` in the
+[Binder][binder] project, where this repository is included as a git submodule.
+The `Makefile` in this project allows the consumer to override several
+key variables when building as part of a larger workspace:
+
+* `PROG` should be set to the fully qualified path of the target
+  executable
+
+* `OBJ_DIR` can be set to a temporary directory, ideally one specific
+  to the load balancer build so that there are no conflicts; this
+  allows the submodule clone to remain pristine during the build
+
+* `CTFCONVERT` must be set to the path of the `ctfconvert` program
+
+## Debugging
+
+Built binaries include CTF type information, allowing an engineer to inspect C
+objects in either the running program or in a core file.  Most subsystems
+declare some set of "anchor" objects as globals, which are easy to locate in
+the debugger.
+
+For instance, the set of backends is stored in an AVL tree (see `backends.c`):
+
+```
+[root@ad443830 (nameservice) ~]$ pgrep -fl balancer
+37229 /opt/smartdc/binder/lib/balancer -s /var/run/binder/sockets
+
+[root@ad443830 (nameservice) ~]$ mdb -o nostop -p 37229

+        avl_balance = 0
+    }

+```

+    to_run_at = 0
+    to_expiry = 0x317f0441d5a87
+    to_func = backend_send_heartbeat
+    to_arg = 0x80c2f48
+    to_active = 0x1 (B_TRUE)
+}
+```
+
+Or the list of known remote hosts and their current backend (see `remotes.c`):
+
+```
+> g_remotes::walk avl | ::printf "%12p %12I -> %d\n" remote_t . rem_addr.S_un.S_addr rem_backend

+     80b0490  10.77.77.72 -> 5301
+...
+```
+
+The Binder project ships a tool, [`balstat`][balstat], which presents this
+debugging information in a form that is often useful to operators.
